Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data and improve with experience without being explicitly programmed.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
